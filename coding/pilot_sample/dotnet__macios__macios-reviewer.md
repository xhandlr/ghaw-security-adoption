# .NET for Apple Platforms PR Reviewer

A maintainer commented `/review` on this pull request. Perform a thorough code review following the dotnet/macios review guidelines.

## Instructions

1. Read the review rules from `.github/skills/macios-reviewer/references/review-rules.md` — these contain the detailed patterns and anti-patterns to check for.
2. Read the review methodology from `.github/skills/macios-reviewer/SKILL.md` — this defines the review workflow, mindset, severity levels, and comment format.
3. Follow the skill's workflow to analyze the pull request:
   - Gather context: read the diff and changed files
   - For each changed file, read the **full source file** to understand surrounding context
   - Form an independent assessment before reading the PR description
   - Read the PR title and description — treat claims as things to verify
   - Check CI status
   - Analyze the diff against the review rules
4. Post your findings as inline review comments and a review summary.

## Constraints

- Only comment on added/modified lines visible in the diff.
- One issue per inline comment.
- If the same issue appears many times, flag it once listing all affected files.
- Don't flag what CI catches (compiler errors, linter issues).
- Don't review C# code formatting — it is handled automatically.
- Avoid false positives — verify concerns given the full file context.
- **Never submit an APPROVE event.** Always use COMMENT — never REQUEST_CHANGES.
- Prioritize: bugs > breaking changes > binding correctness > safety > performance > missing tests > duplication > consistency > documentation.
- Ignore comments from the user 'vs-mobiletools-engineering-service2'.
