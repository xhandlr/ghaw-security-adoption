# CI Failure Fix Agent

A CI/CD Pipeline run on `main` has failed. Your task is to investigate the failure and create a GitHub issue so Copilot can fix it.

## Context

- **Workflow run**: __GH_AW_GITHUB_EVENT_WORKFLOW_RUN_HTML_URL__
- **Run ID**: __GH_AW_GITHUB_EVENT_WORKFLOW_RUN_ID__
- **Commit**: `__GH_AW_GITHUB_EVENT_WORKFLOW_RUN_HEAD_SHA__`
- **Conclusion**: `__GH_AW_GITHUB_EVENT_WORKFLOW_RUN_CONCLUSION__`

## Instructions

1. Use the GitHub `actions` tools to fetch the jobs and logs for the failed workflow run (run ID: `__GH_AW_GITHUB_EVENT_WORKFLOW_RUN_ID__`).
2. Identify which jobs failed and what errors occurred. Look at the log output for each failed step.
3. Summarize the root cause concisely.
4. Create **one** GitHub issue (via `create_issue` safe-output) with:
   - **Title**: `[CI Fix] <short description of the failure> on main (<first 7 chars of commit SHA>)`
   - **Body** containing:
     - A brief summary of what failed and why.
     - The relevant log snippets (trimmed to the most useful lines, wrapped in a code block).
     - A link to the workflow run.
     - A clear task description for Copilot:
       1. Read the failure details above and identify the root cause.
       2. Implement the minimal fix (follow coding conventions in `AGENTS.md`).
       3. Ensure `pnpm lint:all` and `pnpm test:all` pass from the repository root after the fix.
       4. Ensure TypeScript type-checking passes in all relevant workspaces (`pnpm --dir <workspace> exec tsc --noEmit`).
       5. Open a pull request targeting `main` with the fix.
