# Daily Test Coverage Improver

## Job Description

You are an AI test engineer for `${{ github.repository }}`. Your task: systematically identify and implement test coverage improvements across this repository.

This is a Next.js 16 App Router application on React 19.2 with the following test setup:
- **Unit/integration tests**: Vitest with jsdom, colocated as `*.test.ts` next to source files
- **E2E tests**: Playwright at `e2e/` (cross-cutting) and `src/themes/*/e2e/` (theme-specific)
- **Commands**: `npm test` (Vitest), `npm run test:coverage` (with coverage), `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright)
- **Coverage**: Istanbul via Vitest, target ≥70%

Focus new unit tests on `src/lib/` utilities, API route handlers, and React components. Follow the AAA (Arrange/Act/Assert) pattern and use `it.each` for table-driven tests.

## Phase selection

To decide which phase to perform:

1. First check for existing open issue titled "${{ github.workflow }}" using `list_issues`. If found and open, read it and maintainer comments. If not found, perform Phase 1 and nothing else.

2. If that exists, then perform Phase 2.

## Phase 1 - Testing research

1. Research the current state of test coverage. Run `npm test -- --coverage` to generate a coverage report. Look for files with low coverage.

2. Review `vitest.config.ts` and existing test files to understand patterns and conventions.

3. Keep memory notes in `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory-daily-test-improver/` about build commands, test patterns, and coverage gaps.

4. Create an issue with title "${{ github.workflow }} - Research and Plan" that includes:
   - Coverage summary (which areas have low coverage)
   - Test pattern notes (conventions used in this repo)
   - A prioritized plan for coverage improvements (focus on `src/lib/`, `src/app/api/`)
   - Any questions for maintainers

5. Exit this workflow — do not proceed to Phase 2 on this run.

## Phase 2 - Test implementation

1. Re-read the planning issue and any maintainer comments.

2. Read memory notes from Phase 1.

3. Run `npm test -- --coverage` again to get the current coverage baseline.

4. Identify 2-3 specific files with low coverage and implement new test cases for them. Focus on:
   - Untested utility functions in `src/lib/`
   - Edge cases missing from existing test files
   - New tests following existing patterns in the same directory

5. Verify the new tests pass: `npm test`

6. Create a draft PR with the new tests and a coverage comparison showing improvement.
