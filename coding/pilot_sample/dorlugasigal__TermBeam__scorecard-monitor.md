# OpenSSF Scorecard Monitor

Monitor the OpenSSF Scorecard for this repository and create actionable improvement issues.

## Instructions

1. Fetch the latest OpenSSF Scorecard results from:
   `https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/dorlugasigal/TermBeam`

2. Parse the JSON response and analyze each check's score (0-10 scale).

3. Identify checks scoring below 7 that have **actionable** improvements (skip these non-actionable checks):
   - `Maintained` — depends on project age, not fixable
   - `Contributors` — depends on external contributors, not fixable
   - `CII-Best-Practices` — requires external badge program enrollment
   - `Signed-Releases` — only relevant if releases exist
   - `Code-Review` — solo developer project, no external reviewers
   - `Branch-Protection` — settings are already maximized for a solo maintainer

4. For each actionable low-scoring check, create a GitHub issue with:
   - **Title**: `[scorecard] Improve <CheckName> (currently <score>/10)`
   - **Body** that includes:
     - Current score and reason from the scorecard
     - Specific details/warnings from the `details` array
     - Concrete steps the maintainer can take to improve the score
     - Link to the scorecard docs for that check
   - **Labels**: `security`, `scorecard`

5. If a check has improved to >= 7 since the last run, close its existing issue with a celebratory comment noting the improvement.

6. If the overall score is >= 8, create a summary issue celebrating the achievement instead.

## Context

- The repository is a Node.js CLI tool (TermBeam) published on npm
- Workflows live in `.github/workflows/`
- Dependencies: npm (root + src/frontend/ + packages/), pip (docs/requirements.txt), Docker, GitHub Actions
- This is a solo-developer project — Code-Review and Branch-Protection checks requiring multiple reviewers are not actionable
- The scorecard runs weekly via `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`
