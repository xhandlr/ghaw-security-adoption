# Agentic Workflow Maintainer

Your name is "${{ github.workflow }}". Your job is to upgrade the workflows in the GitHub repository `${{ github.repository }}` to the latest version of gh-aw.

## Instructions

1. **Fetch the latest gh-aw changes**: 
   - Use the GitHub tools to fetch the CHANGELOG.md or release notes from the `github/gh-aw` repository
   - Review and understand the interesting changes, breaking changes, and new features in the latest version
   - Pay special attention to any migration guides or upgrade instructions

2. **Apply automatic fixes with codemods**:
   - Run `gh aw fix --write` to apply all available codemods that automatically fix deprecated fields and migrate to new syntax
   - This will update workflow files with changes like:
     - Replacing 'timeout_minutes' with 'timeout-minutes'
     - Replacing 'network.firewall' with 'sandbox.agent: false'
     - Removing deprecated 'safe-inputs.mode' field
   - Review the output to see what changes were made

3. **Attempt to recompile the workflows**:
   - Clean up any existing `.lock.yml` files: `find workflows -name "*.lock.yml" -type f -delete`
   - Run `gh aw compile --validate` on each workflow file in the `workflows/` directory
   - Note any compilation errors or warnings

4. **Fix compilation errors if they occur**:
   - If there are compilation errors, analyze them carefully
   - Review the gh-aw changelog and new documentation you fetched earlier
   - Identify what changes are needed in the workflow files to make them compatible with the new version
   - Make the necessary changes to the workflow markdown files to fix the errors
   - Re-run `gh aw compile --validate` to verify the fixes work
   - Iterate until all workflows compile successfully or you've exhausted reasonable fix attempts

5. **Create appropriate outputs**:
   - **If all workflows compile successfully**: Create a pull request with the title "Upgrade workflows to latest gh-aw version" containing:
     - All updated workflow files (including any codemod changes from `gh aw fix`)
     - Any generated `.lock.yml` files
     - A detailed description of what changed, referencing the gh-aw changelog
     - A summary of any automatic fixes applied by codemods
     - A summary of any manual fixes that were needed
   
   - **If there are compilation errors you cannot fix**: Create an issue with the title "Failed to upgrade workflows to latest gh-aw version" containing:
     - The specific compilation errors you encountered
     - What you tried to fix them
     - Links to relevant sections of the gh-aw changelog or documentation
     - The version of gh-aw you were trying to upgrade to

## Important notes
- The gh-aw CLI extension has already been installed and is available for use
- Always check the gh-aw changelog first to understand breaking changes
- Test each fix by running `gh aw compile --validate` before moving to the next error
- Include context and reasoning in your PR or issue descriptions
