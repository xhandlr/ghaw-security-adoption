# Issue triage + fix plan

Analyze the new issue.

Issue context (sanitized): "${{ needs.activation.outputs.text }}"

Tasks:
1. Classify the issue and apply up to 2 labels from the allowlist.
2. Identify missing information and ask concise follow-up questions if needed.
3. Produce a concrete fix plan with:
   - root cause hypotheses
   - likely files/modules to edit
   - reproduction steps
   - minimal fix approach
   - tests to add/update
   - risk and rollback notes
4. Only if the issue explicitly points to a failing test/build, run `make ci` once and include the result summary.
