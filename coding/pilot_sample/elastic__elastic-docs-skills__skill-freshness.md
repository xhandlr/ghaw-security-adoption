# Weekly Skill Freshness Check

Check all skills in `skills/**/SKILL.md` for staleness against their upstream source URLs.

## Process

1. Find every `SKILL.md` file under the `skills/` directory.
2. For each skill:
   - Read the SKILL.md file.
   - Parse the `sources:` list from its YAML frontmatter.
   - **If `sources:` exists**: fetch each source URL (append `.md` for the LLM-friendly variant, e.g. `https://www.elastic.co/docs/contribute-docs/style-guide.md`).
   - **If no `sources:` field**: use the Elastic Docs MCP server (`https://www.elastic.co/docs/_mcp/`) to find relevant upstream content. Call `SemanticSearch` with the skill's name and description to discover related documentation pages. Then fetch the top results with `GetDocumentByUrl` (with `includeBody: true`) and compare them against the skill.
   - Compare the fetched content against the rules, syntax, and options encoded in the skill.
   - If the skill is stale (new rules added, syntax changed, options removed, links broken), update the SKILL.md to reflect the current upstream state. If the skill lacked `sources:` and you found relevant upstream pages, add them to the frontmatter.
   - After updating a skill, run its evals to catch regressions (see "Post-update eval check" below).
3. If any files changed:
   - Read `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and bump its `version` field (patch increment — e.g. `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`).
   - Request a pull request using the `create-pull-request` safe output exactly once, summarizing what drifted, why, and eval results.
4. If nothing changed, close this issue with a comment confirming all skills are current.

## Pull request creation rules

When files change, the `create-pull-request` safe output is the only mechanism for opening the pull request.

- Emit exactly one `create-pull-request` safe output.
- Do not run `gh pr create` or any other pull request creation command.
- Do not write additional pull request JSON files manually.
- Do not emit `report_incomplete` after emitting `create-pull-request`.
- After emitting the `create-pull-request` safe output, stop and provide only a brief summary.

## Post-update eval check

After updating a skill, check whether `evals/evals.json` exists in the skill directory. If it does:

1. **Before editing**, read the original SKILL.md content and save it mentally as the "old version."
2. **After editing**, for each eval in `evals/evals.json`:
   - Read the eval prompt and expectations.
   - Follow the **updated** skill's instructions to accomplish the eval prompt.
   - Grade your output against each expectation (PASS/FAIL with evidence).
3. **Compare**: Note any expectations that the updated skill fails. If the update causes regressions (expectations that would have passed with the old version now fail), flag these in the PR body.
4. **Include results** in the PR body under a "### Eval results" section for each updated skill:

```markdown
### Eval results

#### <skill-name>
| Eval | Pass Rate | Regressions |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 — <prompt summary> | 3/4 (75%) | None |
| 2 — <prompt summary> | 2/3 (67%) | ❌ "expectation text" — was passing before update |
```

If all evals pass, note "All evals passing" instead of the table.

If no evals exist for a skill, note "No evals available" and skip.
