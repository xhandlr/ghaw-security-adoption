# Skill Quality Review

Review skills changed in this PR for quality issues and post a comment with findings.

## Process

1. List the files changed in this PR. Identify every `SKILL.md` under `skills/`.
2. For each changed skill, read the full `SKILL.md` file.
3. Evaluate the skill against the criteria below.
4. Post a comment on the PR summarizing your findings across all changed skills, updating any existing comment from a previous run (see "Comment idempotency" below). This is advisory only.

## Evaluation criteria

### Structure (from skill-validator)

- File starts with valid YAML frontmatter between `---` delimiters.
- Required frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`, `version`.
- `name` is kebab-case, starts with `docs-`, and is unique across the catalog.
- The skill directory name is kebab-case.
- `version` is valid SemVer.
- No unclosed code fences in the markdown body.
- No broken internal links (references to files that don't exist in the skill directory).

### Content quality (from skill-validator)

- **Token efficiency**: The skill body should be under 500 lines. Longer skills should justify their length with proportionally more actionable content.
- **Code block ratio**: Code examples should be present but not dominate. A ratio above 0.4 suggests the skill may be a code dump rather than instructional content.
- **Imperative language**: Skills should use imperative voice ("Use X", "Add Y", "Check Z"). A very low imperative ratio (< 0.05) suggests the skill is descriptive rather than actionable.
- **Instruction specificity**: Rules and instructions should be specific enough to act on without ambiguity. Vague guidance like "follow best practices" is not useful.

### Clarity and actionability (from Claude Skills documentation)

- **Clear trigger**: The `description` field should make it obvious when to use the skill. It should describe both what the skill does and the situations that trigger it.
- **Scoped purpose**: The skill should do one thing well. If it tries to cover too many topics, it becomes harder for the agent to apply correctly.
- **Actionable instructions**: Every section should tell the agent what to do, not just describe concepts. Prefer concrete rules over abstract guidance.
- **Examples**: Non-trivial syntax or patterns should include examples. Examples should be minimal and focused — just enough to illustrate the point.
- **No redundancy with training data**: Skills are most valuable when they encode information the model doesn't already know — project-specific conventions, proprietary syntax, or domain rules. Restating widely-known information (standard markdown, common git commands) wastes tokens and can degrade output quality.

### Contamination awareness

- Code examples should be in the language relevant to the skill's domain. Mixing unrelated languages, such as Python examples in a markup-focused skill, can confuse the agent.
- If multiple languages are necessary, they should be clearly scoped to specific sections.

## Comment format

Post a single comment with this structure:

```
## Skill Quality Review

### <skill-name>

**Overall**: [Brief 1-sentence assessment]

**Strengths**:
- [What the skill does well]

**Issues** (if any):
- [Specific issue with actionable suggestion]

**Suggestions** (if any):
- [Optional improvements, not blockers]
```

If all skills look good, keep it short:

```
## Skill Quality Review

### <skill-name>

Looks good — clear trigger, actionable instructions, appropriate scope.
```

Do not nitpick formatting or stylistic preferences. Focus on issues that would affect the skill's effectiveness when used by an agent.

## Comment idempotency

Before posting, search existing PR comments for one that starts with `## Skill Quality Review`. If found, **update that comment** instead of creating a new one. This prevents duplicate comments on re-runs.
