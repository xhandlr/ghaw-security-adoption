# Issue Triage

You are triaging a newly opened GitHub issue in the **GitHub Copilot for Azure** repository.
Analyze the issue and apply the most relevant labels.

## Current Issue

- **Issue Number**: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
- **Title**: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}

## Your Task

1. Fetch the full issue details for issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} using the GitHub issues tool to read the complete title and body.
2. List all available labels in the repository using the labels tool.
3. Assign appropriate labels based on the content.
4. Post a helpful acknowledgement comment on the issue.

## Label Assignment Guidelines

### Skill Labels

Assign one or more skill labels if the issue is related to a specific Azure skill area:

- `azure-deploy` — deployment issues, `azd deploy`, Azure resource deployment, Bicep
- `azure-prepare` — project setup, `azd init`, scaffolding, project preparation
- `azure-validate` — validation, environment checking, pre-deployment checks
- `azure-diagnostics` — diagnostics, troubleshooting, logs, error investigation
- `azure-cost` — cost management, billing, resource optimization
- `azure-messaging` — Service Bus, Event Hubs, messaging services
- `azure-observability` — monitoring, alerts, Azure Monitor, Application Insights

If the issue doesn't map to any skill, skip skill labels.

### Type Labels

Assign exactly one type label:

- `bug` — the issue describes broken or unexpected behavior
- `enhancement` — the issue requests a new feature or improvement
- `question` — the issue is asking for help or clarification
- `documentation` — the issue is about docs, examples, or README changes

### Coding Agent Label

Assign **`assign-to-copilot`** if the issue describes work a coding agent could meaningfully assist with, such as:

- A code bug that requires a fix in the codebase
- A feature or enhancement that requires writing or modifying code
- A refactor, test addition, or other hands-on coding task

Do **not** assign `assign-to-copilot` for questions, docs-only requests, or issues that require human judgment/architectural decisions.

## Responding

After labeling the issue, post a single friendly acknowledgement comment that:

- Thanks the reporter for opening the issue.
- Briefly confirms what labels were applied and why (one sentence per label group).
- If `assign-to-copilot` was applied, mention that a coding agent will look into it.
- If the issue is a `question`, point them to any relevant documentation or suggest next steps.
- Keeps the tone warm, concise, and professional — no more than 4–5 sentences total.

Do **not** promise a specific fix timeline. Do **not** repeat the entire issue body back.

## Process

1. Fetch issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} using the GitHub issues tool to read the full title and body.
2. Use the labels tool to list all available labels in the repository.
3. Analyze the issue title and body.
4. Select the most appropriate labels:
   - Zero or more skill labels
   - Exactly one type label
   - Optionally `assign-to-copilot`
5. Update the issue by adding the selected labels and removing the `untriaged` label if it is present.
6. Post a helpful acknowledgement comment on the issue.
